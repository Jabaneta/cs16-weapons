## Introduction
This datapack tries to copy the feel of Counter Strike 1.6.
While the basic weapons will comply with the feel of cs1.6, I will add other weapons that will be completely different in feel.

## Changes upragding the datapack to 1.21.4
Summary:
The datapack was initially made on 1.19.4 on a server with different pvp gamemodes, a lot of handling was done by the cs16 datapack instead of the games.
Now the this datapack is a standalone version. No "api's" or "handlers" for redirecting damage, what happends when a player dies, etc.

The datapack will just work once you put it in your world. Right now it is not survival friendly since you can not craft any guns or ammo.

### Removed old bullet storage mechanic:
Now all ammo is in item form stored in player inventory.\
Damage scaling on guns removed( the player health was seen as from 0..100 instead of 0..20)

### Loot Tables:
Guns are separated by type and you can get one by typing:
loot give @s cs16:gun/<gun_type>/<gun_name>

Getting ammo:
loot give @s loot cs16:ammo/<gun_type>\
Full stack: cs16:ammo/<gun_type>_stack\
Or random: cs16:ammo, cs16:rifle, cs16:smg,cs16:pistol\

## CONFIGURATIONS:

use /function cs16:config for text gui

$preventDeath: 0 or 1 (1 - prevents the gun damage from killing the player, instead the player will run function cs16:redirect_on_death)\
- There is a demo in pvp namepsace, where the player instead of being killed is put in spectator mode, spectating a block display following the player who killed him.( Just like in cs1.6)

$gunRange 0..1024 <> 1024 By default\
- :⚠️ The raytracing may run a lot of commands depending on gun stats. So the raytrace may reach maxCommandChainLength.\
### $gunGrief
- 0: guns won't break blocks( depending on block_pen stat)
- 1: guns will break blocks
- How gun grief works:\ There are 3 block tags: immune( blocks cannot get destroyed by weapons), hard( Health of 1000 hit points) and soft(120 hit points). If the block is not found is those tags is considered a normal block witch has 450 hit points. Each gun has a block_pen score, this determines how much damage it deals to each block.  
### $wallbang 0 or 1( 1-thru wall damage)\
- 0 The bullet will stop at the first block hit.
- 1 The bullet will pass thru blocks halfing it's damage
### $transform_item_to_display 0 or 1( converts gun items to item displays and can be only be picked up by pressing shift near it)
